# CrossPoint SD-card plugins

Browser-side plugins the CrossPoint web UI loads from the SD card. Each is just
JS + a manifest — **no firmware changes to add one.** The device discovers them,
serves them, injects them into a page, and backs them with generic device
capabilities (an outbound HTTP(S) relay, crypto primitives, SD read/write, and
URL-to-SD download).

A plugin can extend either the **File Manager** or the **Settings** page — its
`manifest.json` `mount` decides which. That makes them useful for things like
tidying a library (sort books into folders by author), batch-optimizing or
renaming files, or opening protected content from an online provider.

## Install

The easiest path: download
[`plugin-store.zip`](https://github.com/itsthisjustin/sd-plugins/releases/download/plugin-store/plugin-store.zip)
and unzip it at the **root of your SD card** — it installs the Plugin Store
plugin, and every other plugin here can then be installed from the store
itself (web UI → Settings → Plugin Store, or on the reader under Settings →
System → Plugins).

To install any plugin by hand instead, copy its folder to the SD card under
any of these roots:

```
/.crosspoint/plugins/<name>/     or   /plugins/<name>/   or   /.plugins/<name>/
    manifest.json     (optional)
    plugin.js         (optional)
    device.json       (optional)
    ...any other assets
```

All three roots are scanned; `/plugins/` and `/.plugins/` at the card root are
just easier to reach when copying from a computer. If the same plugin name
exists in more than one root, the earlier one in the list above wins.

Reconnect to the device web UI; the plugin's card appears on its page. A
`device.json` also appears on the reader under Settings → System → Plugins.

## Layout of this folder

- `hello/` — minimal example; proves the loader end to end (no network).
- `organize-by-author/` — a File Manager plugin: reads each EPUB in the current
  folder and files it into a per-author subfolder. Uses only the same-origin
  File Manager endpoints and the JSZip the page already loads — a good template
  for "operate on the files I'm looking at" plugins. EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 creator
  sort names are supported; reading progress, cache data, and visible
  `.epub.rights` sidecars move with their book.
- `bookfusion/` — a Settings plugin + `device.json` pair: sign in to
  BookFusion from the web page or on the reader itself (device-code flow with
  QR), then browse and download your library on-device under Settings >
  System > Plugins. Writes each book's `<book>.meta.json` sidecar with its
  BookFusion id, which rides KOSync progress uploads (enable "Send book
  metadata" on the reader) so a CrossPoint sync server can forward progress
  to BookFusion.
- `webdav/` — a Settings plugin + `device.json` pair: enter a WebDAV server
  URL and credentials in the web page (stored in `/.crosspoint/webdav.json`),
  then browse folders and download books on the reader itself under Settings >
  System > Plugins. Works with Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile, Koofr, and any
  standard WebDAV share.
- `plugin-store/` — install other plugins from one or more hosted catalogs; see [`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md) for the catalog spec.
- `dictionaries/` — a Settings plugin + `device.json` pair: install offline
  monolingual dictionaries (a word explained in its own language — for
  looking up words in a book, not translating) for the reader's built-in
  dictionary lookup. ~20 languages, generated from each language's own
  Wiktionary edition plus Webster's 1913 for English by a scheduled mirror
  workflow. Browse and download on the reader (Settings > System > Plugins)
  or from the web page; files land as loose StarDict files in
  `/dictionaries/<name>/`. The web page can also set the active dictionary
  (`dictionaryName` in settings.json).
- `fonts/` — a Settings plugin that installs precompiled `.cpfont` families
  (6–18 pt, CrossGlyph builds of curated WP-Fonts) from a catalog repo into
  `/.fonts/<Familia>/`: previews rendered by the reader's own renderer,
  per-size selection, active-family picker (`sdFontFamilyName`). Catalog and
  builds are produced by the companion cp-fonts repo.
- `wallabag/` — a Settings plugin + `device.json` pair: read your Wallabag
  "read it later" articles on the device (Wallabag exports each as EPUB, so no
  conversion). Enter server URL + API client + login in the web page; the
  reader signs in silently (OAuth2 password grant) and downloads articles.
  Works with self-hosted Wallabag or app.wallabag.it.
- `protected-content/` — a File Manager plugin that connects the reader to a
  protected-content provider, using the device relay + crypto. It detects an
  existing `/.crosspoint/content.key`, restores its fulfillment session, and lists
  `.acsm` files uploaded into the folder currently being viewed. Full flow:
  activate the device
  (identity → bootstrap → sign-in → activate, writing `/.crosspoint/content.key`),
  then fulfills a selected `.acsm` uploaded through the File Manager — the
  device downloads the book to the SD-card root, writes a `<book>.epub.rights`
  sidecar the reader decrypts on-device, and deletes the `.acsm` after the
  complete operation succeeds. The request-signing canonicalization follows the
  reference implementation.

### Protected Content example limitations

- Credentials created by an older plugin version are detected, but need one
  reactivation to add the persisted fulfillment session. The reader ignores
  those additional forward-compatible fields.
- The final EPUB download URL must return the file directly. The device streams
  that response to SD and does not currently follow a redirect from `/api/fetch`.
- The smoke suite exercises the complete protocol shape with mocked services;
  a real account and authorization file are still needed for a live service test.

## Development

### Creating a plugin with Claude

This repo ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that
knows the whole plugin contract — the browser `api` object, the `device.json`
schema, the firmware's hard limits (32 KB relay cap, 8 KB manifest cap, no
redirect-follow on `/api/fetch`, no on-device archive extraction), store
registration, and the test conventions. With Claude Code open in this repo,
just describe the plugin you want:

```
> build a plugin that syncs reading progress to my Calibre server
```

Claude picks up the skill automatically (it lives in
[`.claude/skills/create-plugin/`](.claude/skills/create-plugin/)) and will
scaffold the folder, write `plugin.js`/`device.json` against the documented
firmware behavior, register the plugin in `catalog.json`, and add tests. You
can also invoke it explicitly with `/create-plugin`. The skill's
[reference sheet](.claude/skills/create-plugin/reference.md) doubles as
human-readable documentation of the device API and `device.json` schema —
useful even without Claude.

### Tests

The examples have a dependency-free Node smoke suite:

```sh
npm test
```

It exercises plugin registration, author metadata parsing, protected-book
sidecar moves, account activation, fulfillment, unique download names, the
one-time credential write, and rights writes with mocked device APIs.

## Security model

Plugins are JavaScript loaded into the File Manager or Settings page, not an
isolated iframe. They can call the same-origin web API and any generic device
capabilities exposed by the host. Install only plugins whose source you trust,
because network relay and download requests are unrestricted. Never put secrets
in a plugin folder.

## Contract

**manifest.json** (optional):
```json
{
  "title": "Sort EPUBs by author",   // card heading; defaults to the folder name
  "mount": "files"                   // "files" (File Manager) or "settings"
}
```

**plugin.js** registers a render function; the host calls it with a container and an api:
```js
CrossPoint.registerPlugin((container, api) => {
  container.innerHTML = '<h2>My plugin</h2>...';
  // api.name                              -> this plugin's name
  // api.relay(method, url, headers, body) -> { status, body, headers }
  //     device makes the HTTP(S) call (browsers can't, due to CORS);
  //     request headers are an object; response headers are an ordered list of
  //     [name, value] pairs with duplicates preserved (including every
  //     Set-Cookie).
  // api.cookiesFrom(resp, existing?)      -> a "k=v; k2=v2" Cookie string,
  //     built from a relay response's Set-Cookie headers (carry a session
  //     across requests). Generic: it just reads the standard header.
  // api.crypto(op, fields)                -> wolfSSL primitive (base64 I/O)
  // api.writeFile(path, dataB64)          -> write a small file to SD
  // api.fetchToSd(url, dest, headers)     -> device downloads a URL to SD
  // api.pluginFile(file)                  -> URL to another file in this plugin folder
  // api.registerAction(name, fn)          -> expose an action external systems can
  //     trigger through the device job queue (POST /api/plugin-jobs). fn(args)
  //     runs in this page whenever it is open (including /plugins-run); return a
  //     small result object, or throw to fail the job.
});
```

A File Manager plugin can also just call the same-origin endpoints the page
already uses (`/api/files`, `/mkdir`, `/move`, `/download`) — see
`organize-by-author/` — so many plugins need nothing from the device api at all.

## Firmware endpoints (generic, scheme-neutral)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins` | list discovered plugins (name/title/mount) |
| `GET /plugin?name=&file=` | serve a file from a plugin folder |
| `POST /api/relay` | device performs an outbound HTTP(S) call for a plugin (any method, incl. PROPFIND) |
| `POST /api/crypto` | generic crypto primitive — hash, random, AES, RSA, PKCS#12 (base64 I/O) |
| `POST /api/fetch` | device downloads a URL straight to SD |
| `POST /api/plugin-fs` | plugin writes a small file to SD |
| `POST /api/plugin-jobs` (+ `/claim`, `/complete`, `/status`) | job queue: external systems trigger registered plugin actions |
| `GET /plugins-run` | headless page that executes queued jobs while open |

## On-device screens (`device.json`)

A plugin can also ship a `device.json` describing an on-device catalog screen
(sign in via OAuth device-code, browse an authenticated JSON API, search it,
download to SD, write per-book sidecars) that appears under **Settings >
System > Plugins** on the reader itself, no phone needed once set up. The
manifest is pure data; the firmware interprets it with one generic activity.
Schema reference: `docs/sd-plugins.md` in the crosspoint-reader repository.
See `bookfusion/` for a complete example that ships both `plugin.js` (browser
sign-in) and `device.json` (on-device sign-in + library browsing).

### On-device search

If the catalog's server can answer queries, add a `search` block under
`browse` and the browsing screen gains a search action that opens the
on-device keyboard:

```json
"browse": {
  "url": "https://example.com/api/items?page={page}&perPage={limit}",
  "search": {
    "url": "https://example.com/api/search?term={query}&page={page}&perPage={limit}"
  }
}
```

- `{query}` is the typed text, URL-encoded (safe in a URL); `{query_raw}` is
  the verbatim text, for POST-body templates.
- `search.url` and `search.body` each fall back to the browse `url`/`body`
  when unset — so an API that searches via a body field only needs
  `search.body`.
- Results are paged like any browse view (`{page}`/`{limit}` still apply),
  span the whole catalog rather than the current list, and **Back** returns
  to the pre-search view.
- JSON catalogs only (XML browse navigates by folder instead), and the server
  does the matching — a static file host can't answer `{query}`, which is why
  the `dictionaries/` catalog doesn't use it.

`bookfusion/` is the live example: its API searches via a body field, so its
`device.json` sets only `search.body` (with `{query_raw}` inside the JSON
string) and reuses the browse URL.
